# Specification Quality Checklist: Sprint 2 - Adaptive Reasoning Engine

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- All 61 functional requirements are clearly defined and testable
- All 5 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios covering the five Tier-1 capabilities
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (13 success criteria defined)
- Edge cases are comprehensively identified (12 edge cases documented)
- Out of scope items are explicitly documented
- Kernel <800 LOC constraint is clearly specified and measurable
- Declarative plan purity and deterministic execution model constraints are preserved
